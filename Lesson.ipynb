We store this information in a _variable_, similar to how you would in math! We will cover 4 major variables today: int, float, boolean, and str. \n1. <span style= \"color: red\"> int: <span style= \"color: black\"> Holds any whole number. In other words, holds an (int)eger\n    - Examples: 3, 195, -4, -1358\n2. <span style= \"color: red\"> float: <span style= \"color: black\"> Holds any decimal. \n    - Examples: 3.14, 0.195, -4.976, -1358\n3. <span style= \"color: red\"> boolean: <span style= \"color: black\"> Holds either True or False. \n4. <span style= \"color: red\"> string: <span style= \"color: black\"> Holds words/single letters. They are represented with single or double quotes around the string \n    - Examples: \"Hello\", 'I love Python'\n    \n<font size = 3> Now that we inderstand what variables are, let's learn how to use variables to code! We will assign values to variables and plug them into expressions - this is called _variable assignment_.  \nThere are 3 steps to assigning a value to a variable:  \n<font size = 3>\n1. The **name** of the variable  \n_you can call your variable anything you'd like, but try to be descriptive for good coding practice_\n    - Bad examples: x = 21, y = 'Varshini'\n    - Good examples: my_age = 21, my_name = 'Varshini'\n2. The **assignment operator** (an = sign)  \n3. The **value** you want to store  \n    \n<font size = 3> Check out these examples:  \n<img src=variables.png alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 700px;\"/>\n    \n    \n<font size = 3> However, not all variable names are valid. Your variable name **cannot** _begin_ with a number or match a Python keyword  \n<img src=python_keywords.png alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n    \n<span style= \"color: #3ECC2D\"> **Try messing around with variables names. Are there any other things you cannot name a variable?**","metadata":{},"id":"47649243-7400-4ac7-bd45-73db26b4073f"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"09b6314a-093b-465f-8a8c-7ea7b53e74a5"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!
